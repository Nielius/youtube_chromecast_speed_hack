# Youtube Chromecast Speed Hack
A way to play a youtube video on Chromecast with settable speed

All this does is provide a form and display the video in an iframe. As of March 26th 2017 you can then follow these steps

1. chromecast this page
2. enter a youtube url 
3. set the playback speed
4. click the fullscreen icon

Yay! Can watch videos at 1.5x or 2.x speed on my TV!
